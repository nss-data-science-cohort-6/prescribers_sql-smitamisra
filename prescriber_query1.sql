--92 speciality out of 107 are not in the prescription dataset. 4458 prescribers are not there in the prescription dataset.

--Q2d. Difficult Bonus: Do not attempt until you have solved all other problems! For each specialty, report the percentage of total claims by that specialty which are for opioids. Which specialties have a high percentage of opioids?

--Q6b. For each instance that you found in part a, add a column that indicates whether the drug is an opioid.

--Q6c. Add another column to you answer from the previous part which gives the prescriber first and last name associated with each row.
